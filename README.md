# BookstoreAPI
Implement a RESTful API for a bookstore that allows users to perform CRUD operations on books and implement a complex logical operation for managing book discounts. The API should be built with the Express Framework and Typescript. Please make use of an n-layered architecture.

## Setup
NPM package prerequisites
>npm install express @types/express typescript \
>npm install --save-dev @types/node \
>npm install ts-node-dev

To start the server
>tsc
>npm start

## Unit Testing
I was using Postman in VSCode for testing as I go, but I couldn't figure out how to get these into the repo. \
Instead I settled for using 'curl.exe' in a batch script to test all the CRUD operations.

## Feedback
I found this quite challenging. 
I had to use good deal of ChatGPT and Youtube to get to this stage but I've learned a fair amount from the assignment. \
Apologies if it's not quite up to scratch but this is my best effort given zero XP with Javascript.
